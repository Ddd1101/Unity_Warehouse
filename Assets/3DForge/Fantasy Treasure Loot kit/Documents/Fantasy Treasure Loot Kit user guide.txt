Thanks for purchasing this package.

Animated items:
Stone Chests,
Large Wooden Chests
Small Wooden Chests
as well as the Jewelry Boxes is animation ready.


Ckicking on the Items under /Meshes/Containers/... you can preview the individual open and close animations
1 - 4   Idle
4 - 41  Open
41 - 77 Close

Drag and drop into the scene, hit play and you will see the open or close loop playing

Breakable items:
Crates, Barrels & Urns each have a Fixed State and a Broken state model included for each of the textures sets
They would be used where the developer would swop the fixed model with the broken version and hide the swop
with a particle effect, be it a dust burst, a flame, a flash or what ever they desire.

Textures:
All textures are 512 x 512
I have tested scaling down to 256 x 256 and even 128 x 128 still gives good results.

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website
